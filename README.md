# GraphCAD for Fraud detection
## Dataset
- Alpha : is a Bitcoin trading platform. A single graph is created by adding users as nodes and the rating re- lationships between users as links. Benign users are the platformâ€™s founders or users who are rated positively. Fraudsters are the users who are rated negatively by the benign users
## Model and metrics
- Apply GraphCAD model for fraud detection
- Use AUC and MAPs to evaluate the performance of the model
